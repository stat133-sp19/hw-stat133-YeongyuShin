#*2.Euclidean Distance*#

##Definition [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Euclidean_distance&action=edit&section=1)

The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the [line segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_segment) connecting them.

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinates), if p = (p1, p2,..., pn) and q = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in [Euclidean n-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_space), then the distance (d) from p to q, or from q to p is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#cite_note-Anton-1)

\[d(p,q) = d(q.p) = \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+...+(q_n-p_n)^2)} = \sqrt{\sum_{n=1}^{n}(q_i-p_i)^2}\]

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, p and q may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. [The Euclidean norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_norm), or Euclidean length, or magnitude of a vector measures the length of the vector:[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#cite_note-Anton-1)
